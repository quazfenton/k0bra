Supports Python, Node.js, and Go with minimal Alpine images.","Created microvm_manager.py with Firecracker MicroVM integration for ultra-secure code execution. Features 128MB RAM limit, no network access, automatic cleanup, and rootfs injection for code execution.","Created build_cache_proxy.py with Redis backend, nginx caching layer, Docker volume storage, and tar.gz artifact compression. Features cache key generation from project files, 24h TTL, and build statistics endpoint.","Created cloud_runners.py with Modal.com and AWS Lambda integration. Features auto-platform selection, batch execution, GPU support detection, and unified API for serverless code execution with 5-10 minute timeouts.","Created screenshot_service.py with Selenium-based UI capture, multi-viewport support (desktop/tablet/mobile), batch processing, automatic container monitoring, and comparison image generation. Includes REST API for URL and container screenshot capture.","Created complete Kubernetes deployment manifests including namespace, deployments for all services (k0bra-app, sandbox-executor, build-cache-proxy, screenshot-service), Redis infrastructure, persistent storage, ingress with SSL, network policies, and automated deployment script. Features security constraints, resource limits, health checks, and horizontal scaling.","Created comprehensive telemetry_monitor.py with Prometheus metrics, real-time container monitoring, execution tracking, alert system, and resource usage analytics. Also created service_orchestrator.py to manage all services with health monitoring, auto-restart, and unified API. Updated requirements.txt with all new dependencies."],"modified_files":["/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/sandbox_executor.py","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/microvm_manager.py","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/build_cache_proxy.py","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/cloud_runners.py","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/screenshot_service.py","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/k8s/namespace.yaml","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/k8s/k0bra-deployment.yaml","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/k8s/sandbox-deployment.yaml","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/k8s/redis-deployment.yaml","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/k8s/storage.yaml","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/k8s/screenshot-deployment.yaml","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/k8s/ingress.yaml","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/deploy-k8s.sh","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/telemetry_monitor.py","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/service_orchestrator.py","/home/admin/c0de/k0bra/requirements.txt"],"id":"1762659401235"}
